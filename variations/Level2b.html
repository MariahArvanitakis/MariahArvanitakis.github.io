	<em><li>(I believe in lunatics)<br>
		It’s about the struggle between individuals with jagged passion in their work and today’s<br>
		faceless corporate committees, which claim to understand the needs of the mass audience, <br>
		and are removing the idiosyncrasies, polishing the jags, creating a thought-free, passion-free,<br>
		cultural mush that will not be hated nor loved by anyone. By now, virtually all media,<br>
		architecture, product and graphic design have been freed from ideas, individual passion,<br>
		and have been relegated to a role of corporate servitude, carrying out corporate strategies<br>
		and increasing stock prices. Creative people are now working for the bottom line.</em></li><br>

		<strong><li>Magazine editors have lost their editorial independence, and work for committees of publishers (who work for<br>
			committees of advertisers). TV scripts are vetted by producers, advertisers, lawyers, research specialists,<br>
			layers and layers of paid executives who determine whether the scripts are dumb enough to amuse what they call<br>
			the ‘lowest common denominator’. Film studios out films in front of focus groups to determine whether an ending<br>
			will please target audiences. All cars look the same. Architectural decisions are made by accountants. Ads are<br>
			stupid. Theater is dead.</li></strong><br>

		<em><li>Corporations have become the sole arbiters of cultural ideas and taste in America. Our culture is corporate culture.<br>
			Culture used to be the opposite of commerce, not a fast track to ‘content’- derived riches. Not so long ago captains<br>
			of industry (no angels in the way they acquired wealth) thought that part of their responsibility was to use their millions<br>
			to support culture. Carnegie built libraries, Rockefeller built art museums, Ford created his global foundation. What<br>
			do we now get from our billionaires? Gates? Or Eisner? Or Redstone? Sales pitches. Junk mail. Meanwhile, creative people<br>
			have their work reduced to ‘content’ or ‘intellectual property’. Magazines and films become ‘delivery systems’ for<br>
			product messages.</em></li><br>

		<br>

		<li><strong>But to be fair, the above is only 99 percent true.I offer a modest solution: Find the cracks in the wall. There<br>
			are a very few lunatic entrepreneurs who will understand that culture and design are not about fatter wallets, but<br>
			about creating a future. They will understand that wealth is means, not an end. Under other circumstances they may<br>
			have turned out to be like you, creative lunatics. Believe me, they’re there and when you find them, treat them<br>
			well and use their money to change the world.</strong></li><br>
