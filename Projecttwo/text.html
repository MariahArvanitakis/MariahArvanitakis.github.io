			<h1>CULTURE: Intercom and Expanded Cinema</h1>
			<i>A Proposal and Manifesto By Stan VanDerBeek</i><br>
			<br>
				I should like to share with you a vision I have had concerning motion pictures. This vision concerns the immediate use of motion pictures  or expanded cinema, as a tool for world communication and opens the future of what I like to call "Ethos-Cinema." Motion pictures may be the most important means for world communication.

At this moment motion pictures are the art form of our time. We are on the verge of a new world/new technology /a new art.

<p>When artists shall deal with the world as a work of art. When we shall make motion pictures into an emotional experience tool that shall move art and life closer together. AH this is about to happen. And it is not a second too soon. We are on the verge of a new world new technologies new arts: “CULTURE: INTERCOM" AND EXPANDED CINEMA. It is imperative that we quickly find some way for the entire level of world human understanding to rise to a new human scale. This scale is the world. The technological explosion of this last half cen­tury while the machine that is man. runs the risk of running wild. Technological research, development and involve­ment of the world community has almost completely out-distanced the emotional-sociological (socio-"Iogi­cal") comprehension of this technology.</p>

<p>It is imperative that each and every member of the world community, regardless of age
and cultural back­ground, join the 20th century as quickly as possible. The "technique-power" and "culture-over-reach" that is just beginning to explode in many parts of the earth, is happening so quickly that it has put the logical fulcrum of man's intelligence so far outside himself that he cannot judge or estimate the results of his acts before he commits them. The process of life as an experiment on earth has never been made clearer. It is this danger that man does not have time to talk: to himself. that man does not have means to talk to other men ... the world hangs by a thread of verbs and nouns. Language and culture-semantics are as explosive as nuclear energy. It is imperative that we (the world's artists) invent a new world language that we invent a non-verbal international picture-language I propose the following:</p>

<p>That immediate research begin on the possibility of an international picture-language using fundamentally motion pictures. That we research immediately existing audio-visual devices, to combine these devices into an educational tool, that I shall call an "experience machine" or a "culture-intercom.'' The establishment of audio-visual research centres preferably on an international scale. These centres to explore the existing audio-visual hardware. The development of new image-making devices
(the storage and transfer of image materials, motion pictures, television, computers, video-tape., etc.)</p>

<p>In short, a complete examination of all audio-visual devices and procedures, with the idea in mind to find the best combination of such machines for non-verbal inter-change. The training of artists on an international basis in the use of these image tools.The immediate development of prototype theatres, hereafter called "Movie-Dromes" that incorporate the use of such projection hardware. The immediate research and development of image- events and performances in the ''Movie-Drome.'' The development of new image-making devices (the storage and transfer of image materials, motion pictures, television, computers, video-tape., etc) In short, a complete examination of all audio-visual devices and procedures, with the idea in mind to find the best combination of such machines for non-verbal inter-change. The training of artists on an international basis in the use of these image tools.The immediate development of prototype theatres, hereafter called "Movie-Dromes" that incorporate the use of such projection hardware. The immediate research and development of image- events and performances in the''Movie-Dome.'' I shall call these prototype presentations </p>

"Movie-Murals", "Ethos-Cinema",
''Newsreel of Dreams", ''Feedback",
"Image libraries"

<p>The "movie-dome" would operate as follows; In a spherical dome, simultaneous images of all sorts
would be projected on the entire dome-screen the audience lies down at the outer edge of the dome with their feet towards the centre, thus almost the complete field of view is the dome-screen. Thousands of images would be projected on this screen this image-flow could be compared to the "collage" form of the newspaper, or the three ring circus (both of which suffice the audience with an collision of facts and data) the audience takes what it can or wants from the presentation and makes its own conclusions each member of· the audience will build his own references from the image-flow, in the best sense of the word the visual material is to be presented and each individual makes his own con­clusions or realisations.</p>

<p>A particular example; To prepare an hour-long presentation in the "movie­ dome” using all sorts of
multiplex images, depicting the course of western civilisation since the time of the Egyptians to the present a rapid panoply of graph­ics and light calling upon thousands of images, both still and in motion (with appropriate "sound-images"). It would be possible to compress the last three thou­sand years of western life into such an aspect ratio that we, the audience, can grasp the flow of man, time, and forms of life that have lead us up to the very moment details are not important, it is the total scale of life that is in other words using the past and the immediate present to help us under­stand the likely future Endless filmic variations of this idea are possible in each field of man's endeavour science, math, geo­graphy art, poetry, dance, biology, etc. Endless interpretations and variations of this idea by each culture group and nationality that take it on as a project to be presented in turn to each other culture group (by telstar, film exchange, "film. mobiles," traveling shows, etc. </p>

<p>The purpose and effect of such image-flow, and image density, (also to be called "visual-velocity"), is to both deal with logical understanding, and to pene­trate to unconscious levels, the use of such "emotion-­pictures" would be to reach for the "emotional denominator" of all men. The basis of human life thought and understanding that is non-verbal to provide images that inspire basic intuitive instinct of
self-realisation to inspire all men to good will and "inter and intro-realisation" When I talk of the movie-domes as image libraries, it is understood that such "life-theatres" would use some of the coming techniques (video tape and com­puter inter-play) and thus be real communication and storage centres, that is, by satellite, each dome could receive its images from a world wide library source, store them and program a feedback presentation to the local community that lived near the center, this news­reel feedback, could authentically review the total world image "reality" in an hour long show that gave each member of the audience a sense of the entire world picture the let us say world's work of the month put into an hour.</p>

<p>"Intra-communitronics," or dialogues with other centres· would be likely, and instant reference material via transmission television and telephone could be called for and received at 186,000 m.p.s from anywhere in the world. Thus I call this presentation, a "newsreel of ideas,
of dreams, a movie-mural." An image library, a culture de-compression cham­ber, a culture-inter-com" my concept is in effect the maximum use of the maximum information devices that we now have at our disposal. Certain things might happen if an individual is exposed to an overwhelming information experi­ence ... It might be possible to re-order the levels of aware-ness of any person . . . it certainly will re-order the structure of motion pictures as we know them. Cinema will become a "performing'' art and image-library. I foresee that such centres will have its artist in residence who will orchestrate the image material be bas at his disposal. And will lead to a totally new international art form.</p>

<p>That in probing for the "emotional denominator," it would be possible by the visual "power" of such a presentation to reach any age or culture group irregard­less of culture and background. The "experience machine" could bring anyone on earth up to the 20th century. As the current growth rate risk of explosives to human flesh continues, the risk of survival increases accordingly. It now stands at 200 pound of T.N.T. per human pound of flesh per human on earth. There are an estimated 700 million people who arc unlettered in the world we have no time to lose or mis-calculate. The world and self education process must find a quick solution to re-order itself a revision of itself, an awareness of itself. That is each man, must somehow realise the enor­mous scale of human life and accomplishments on earth right now. Man must find a way to measure himself, to simultaneously grow and keep in touch with himself. Man must find a way to leap over his own prejudice, and apprehensions. The means are on hand here and now. In technology and the extension of the senses.</p>

<p>To summarise:
My concern is for a way for the over-developing technology of part of the world to help the under­developed emotional-sociology of all of the world to catch up to the 20th century to counter-balance technique and logic-and to do it now, quickly. My concern is for world peace and harmony. The appreciation of individual minds.The interlocking of good wills on an international exchange basis.The interchange of images and ideas. A realisation of the process of "realisation" of self-education. That now must occur before the ''fact" of edu­cation.</p>

<p>In short: a way for us men to have fore-knowledge By advantageous use of apt and immediate knowl­edge. Mankind faces the immediate future with doubt on one hand and molecular energy on the other. He must move quickly and surely to preserve his future, He must realise the present.
The here and the right now. An international picture-language is a tool to build that future</p>
