I have chosen the following texts because they all take a critical look at design. This is something which i am interested in exploring and researching futher.
</div>


        <div class="one">
        <p>We no longer have any desire for design that is driven by need. Something less prestigious than a ‘designed’ object can do the same thing for less money. The Porsche Cayenne brings you home, but any car will do the same thing, certainly less expensively and probably just as quickly. But who remembers the first book, the first table, the first house, the first airplane? All these inventions went through a prototype phase, to a more<br>or less fully developed model, which subsequently became design. Invention and a design represent different stages of a technological development, but unfortunately, these concepts are being confused with one another. If the design is in fact the aesthetic refinement of an invention, then there is room for debate about what the ‘design problem’ is. Many designers still use the term ‘problem-solving’ as a non-defined description of their task. But what is in fact the problem? Is it scientific? Is it social? Is it aesthetic? Is the problem the list of prerequisites?<br> Or is the problem the fact that there is no problem?</p>

        <p>Design is added value. En masse, designers throw themselves into desires instead of needs. There is nothing wrong with admitting as much. Konstantin Grcic, Rodolfo Dordoni and Philippe Starck are found in Wallpaper boutiques, not in Aldi supermarkets. Unvaryingly, the poorest families – for they are always around – are still living with second-hand settees in grey, post war neighbourhoods, in a total absence of design. Orchestration of ‘third-world’ design assembled for the cameras cannot escape the image of the world in poverty having to make do without the luxury gadgets that are so typical of contemporary design. The hope that some designers still cherish, of being commissioned to work from the perspective of objective need, is in vain. Design only generates longing. The problem is the problem of luxury.</p>
        	&mdash; <i>Research and Destroy, Daniel Van Der Velden, 2006</i><br>
          <br>
          <b>Daniel explains in his text that we no longer design based on need...
          If there is no need, is design still necessary?</b><br>
      </div>
      <div class="two">
      <p>I don’t consider Dutch Design to be design generated in the Netherlands. I consider
      Dutch Design a kind of work, or an attitude about work, or even a brand of work that
      could theoretically occur anywhere at any time. Because of special conditions in the
      Netherlands, Dutch Design seems to flourish: primarily due to the fact that that there
      exists a culture that understands design, that so many study design, and so much money
      is injected into the system to support “design experiments.” (In America the period
      during the high-tech bubble created a brief moment conducive to such work.) But any
      work that demonstrates the peculiar combination of irony, self-deprecation, and thinly
      veiled egoism can earn the title of Dutch Design</p>

      <p>Our commitment to the private over public represents a vast difference between
the ways we view the issue of “design.” To understand that difference, one must realize
that in America, design is always considered suspect: effete, luxurious, intellectual.
America tends to be a deeply anti-intellectual, antiaesthetic place. So if our government
builds something, it must look as awful and as cheap as possible, thus signifying (1) that
no precious tax dollars were wasted on it; and (2) that no high flatulent “concepts” were
passed off on an unwitting public. We have no tradition of aesthetic functionalism. We
are suspicious of modernity. Modern smells expensive. Modern seems liberal, vaguely
socialist. Modern is for white-wine swilling Northeastern and Hollywood Democrats.
So much Design in one place creates an aggregation of exacerbated difference.
I wonder now, after a twenty-year ejaculation of making, if individual design
doesn’t need to signify anything anymore; it simply needs to look different from other
designs. In that way design shifts from ideology to a kind of branding strategy and
enters its fully linguistic state. The Dutch City becomes a Vegas version of a Dutch
City with its myriad contemporary “attractions.” It’s Holland as an international design
theme park</P>

<p>At a mundane level, what practitioners usually mean by the “real” of the “real world” is money. Time is money and
there isn’t any of it for “pussyfooting around,” for empty talk, for fancy idealism. “A job in industry,” “making a living,” and paying off a student loan or a mortgage—these are real, in the “real world.” In the “real world” your ideals will turn to custard before the might of money and even you, the original talent, the precocious rebel, the cool designer, will be corrupted. Dollar ranks big time, and no one, it seems, can stand up to it.
Yet there must be more; surely there must be a “real” meaning for the “real
world” which is at once representative of something deeper and yet also accommodates
the glib certainty of economic determinism. If one view of the “real world” is that it
is the place where “reality” is the black and red of profit and loss, then such an
unbalanced and limited vision itself represents an implicit failure of the dominant
reductionist outlook of the past two hundred years. Life, even in the real world, cannot
be that simple. In fact, is not life so complex in reality that the reductionist tendency
must be viewed with the suspicion that it actually serves more as a tool for concealment
and denial than of understanding?</P>
<p>The real world, then, is about six times larger than the “real world” of design
practitioners. The latter is an almost wholly owned corporatist subsidiary, concerned
more with squeezing maximum profit out of its one billion overconsumers by selling
them things they don’t need, they can’t afford, and from which globalized manufacture
and branding further damages both the natural and cultural environments on which
the majority of planetary citizens, who are not able to “participate,” depends for their
sustenance. As Eric Hoffer puts it,“You can never get enough of what you don’t really
want.” And this money roller coaster is called success! It seems that the real world is
very badly designed indeed.</P>

<p>There is an enormous “market” for the design of communication ecology and an
emancipatory visuality of social change. In fact, it would seem that the real world not
only needs design praxis, but also itself needs designing from the garden up! But
Papanek’s critique of graphic design focuses on the social products of design and the
social role of designers, not on the processes of designing. He was quite correct to
criticize “the profession” because the profession pursues profit with every bit as much
single-minded zeal as the next businessperson.The profession is reluctant to engage in
real world praxis and to examine critically its central role in the perpetuation of an
ideology of corporatist domination and consumerism, which is antithetical to
democracy and planetary life. Notwithstanding that, surely the process and practice of
designing is a fundamental human activity worth preserving, even if the “profession”
as it stands is not.As Papanek puts it so appositely:“Design is a basic human ability to
help autonomous self-realization.”7 This is why I believe more in the real world of
design education than the unreal world of professional design. It is way past time for
the design profession to get real. Design might well be too important to leave to
designers.</p>
